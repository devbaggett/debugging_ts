Assignment: Debugging TypeScript and ES6  

Objectives:  

Recognize how to use TypeScript and ES6 to supercharge your JavaScript   
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It offers features above and beyond what JavaScript gives us, which is useful while developing. For example, we can declare our data types, so if we accidentally try to pass a string as an argument to a function that is expecting an array, TypeScript will warn us that we're making a mistake. However, browsers understand JavaScript, not TypeScript. Therefore, TypeScript gets transpiled to JavaScript. The Angular community decided early on to adopt TypeScript as its main language of choice when writing Angular applications, and that is what we use here. Use this assignment to get used to writing TypeScript before jumping into Angular. However, keep in mind that TypeScript is optional and only offers benefits while developing, not in the final product.  

Copy the code snippets into the TypeScript Playground tool. Identify the errors found in each code snippet. You will see red bars in the Typescript side of the Playground where there is an error.  

Fix the errors in the Playground so that all the red bars are gone and the code still runs as desired.  
Make comments in the code to explain what each error was and how you fixed it.  
For assignment submission, upload a ".ts" file with the contents of the TypeScript Playground.
